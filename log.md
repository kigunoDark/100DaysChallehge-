# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Day 0: January 15 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Changed a view engine of my web project (ejs now), create a new controllers for user and admin, created new page for admin, and added a dropdown menu for login of admin on a secret page, especially for an admin.

**Thoughts:** I'm not going working tonight, because it was already a hard day.
