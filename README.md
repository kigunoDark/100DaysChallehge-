<h1> Additional Rules </h1>
<p>
   <ul>
      <li> I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.</li>
      <li> If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge. </li>
      <li> I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress. </li>
      <li> I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress. </li>
      <li> I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. </li>
   </ul>
