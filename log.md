# 100 Days Of Code - Log
## Day 0: January 15 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Changed a view engine of my web project (ejs now), create a new controllers for user and admin, created a new page for admin, and added a dropdown menu for the login of admin on a secret page, especially for an admin.

**Thoughts:** I'm not going working tonight, because it was already a hard day.

## Day 1: January 16 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Have finished a login form, also created a register modal form. It wasn't hard work, but it takes time, especially when you need to paste a lot of information. I also learned how to work with a body-parser and file system. 

**Thoughts:** Finished my registration form for one type of users and understood for whom I'm going to develop this project because I found a client.
