# Deal With a Devil 
## 100 Days of challenge
### I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days. 

###  Start Date 
 January 15 2019  

##  Additional Rules 
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.
5. I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge.
